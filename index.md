I’m a problem solver.   I do my best work with clients who want help to find an answer to a problem they’re wrestling with, or an opportunity they want explored.  I’m interested in the issues and I’m keen to find better ways of doing things. 

I take on work where I think I can add something - and if I don’t think I can, I’ll say so (and introduce you to someone else wherever possible). 

What I know most about is public policy in the UK, in and around the labour market, particularly at the point where public bodies work with employers and others to make a difference. 

I’ve spent all my career in the public policy field in the UK, working in senior positions in the public, private and non-profit sectors, and in a range of non-executive roles. 

Alongside The Mackinnon Partnership, I am Secretary to the [Maritime Skills Alliance](http://www.maritimeskills.org/).  You can see my full profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-mackinnon-0413221/).

I’m known for doing high quality work, presented in clear, concise, easy-to-read, reports. 

Please get in touch if you think I might be of some use to you.
