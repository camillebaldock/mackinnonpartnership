title: Drafting the Qualifications Strategy for the maritime sector
---

We have worked with the Maritime Skills Alliance and its core members for many years, (and, indeed, did the work which resulted in its establishment in the first place as a formally-recognised Sector Skills Body), so we were well-placed to help the Alliance to create its first Qualifications Strategy.

Following the structure of Sector Skills Councilsâ€™ strategies, and judged by UKCES using the same criteria, we produced a draft for the MSA Board, based on desk and field research, and consultation with employers and others in each of the four capitals across the UK.
