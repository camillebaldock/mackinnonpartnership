title: Exploring the Olympic legacy at the Lee Valley White Water Centre
---

For two weeks in 2012 all our attention will be on the athletes, but for economic development professionals the big issue is ‘legacy’.

One of the most spectacular facilities for the Olympics will be the new White Water Centre in Broxbourne, Herts, a few miles north of the main stadium – and the only Olympic venue open to the public before the Games.

Iain Mackinnon has recently been part of the team assessing the legacy prospects for the Centre. He identified the different requirements for specialist and lower-level skills and whether jobs will be permanent, seasonal or casual. He also suggested ways to enhance the legacy through work experience and volunteering, and more focused recruitment.

Iain was working as a sub-contractor to Nathaniel Lichfield and Partners, one of the UK's leading independent town planning consultancies. We’ve worked together before, and NLP asked Iain back for his expertise in skills and employment, which complement their own very well.
