title: Defining the ‘Alcohol Workforce’ for Skills for Health
---

Skills for Health has developed a useful tool for capturing the essence of a whole job whilst keeping the scope for local variety. “Nationally Transferable Roles”, as the results are called, cluster competences to help separate employers to work together effectively, reducing costs, improving communication and enhancing patient safety.

So when the previous Government set a target to reduce the number of hospital admissions caused by excess consumption of alcohol, Skills for Health and the Department for Health commissioned us to identify ‘nationally transferable roles’ within the alcohol workforce, as a step towards the workforce development programme needed to underpin the policy target.

We undertook desk research and targeted interviews to focus our work, but the core was collation of over 50 CVs, which we aligned with National Occupational Standards in a large spreadsheet, looking for patterns. We identified three ‘nationally transferable roles’, which were approved through a careful process of consultation and validation: a specialist with professional skills, someone trained to identify signs and give brief advice, and a first line manager operating as a coordinator.

We think the same pattern is likely to apply to other fields where the aim is to change people’s behaviour, from drugs to basic skills.

Our report is available through a link at the foot of [this page](http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/service-area/alcohol-&-drugs).
