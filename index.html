There’s no shortage of consultants who get the basics right, but if you want personal attention from experienced consultants who really do know their field, and who work imaginatively to find solutions to your problems and insights into your practice, you’ve come to the right place.

We are a public policy consultancy, specialising in the labour market. Our core business is research and evaluation, and over the last 12 years we’ve built up a considerable client portfolio across the public sector in the UK, from national agencies to small local initiatives.

We’ve featured a number of case studies on this site to show you more detail about what we do, but inevitably they don’t cover everything. If you have something in mind and you’re not sure if it’s our thing or not, call me direct and ask. I won’t mess you about, because we won’t take on any project we can’t do well. (And if I possibly can, I’ll recommend someone else if we can’t help ourselves).

We are known for doing high quality work, presented in clear, concise, easy-to-read, reports, and work which helps our clients to do their job better.

And we don’t cost the earth. We’ve cut our costs a lot in response to the changed demands of the public sector, so we’re able to offer the same quality as before at a competitive rate. Price alone is a poor basis for buying consultancy - but we know it matters to our clients.
